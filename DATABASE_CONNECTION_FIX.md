# Database Connection Fix - December 2024

## Problem
Excessive Neon database connections causing compute usage spikes and hitting connection limits (905+ connections).

## Root Causes Identified

1. **Connection Storm on Dashboard Load**
   - 4 widgets (Todo, Sales, Calendar, QuickLinks) loading simultaneously
   - Each widget made separate API calls on mount
   - Each API endpoint made 5+ parallel database queries
   - Result: 4 widgets × 5+ queries = 20+ simultaneous connections per user

2. **No Connection Pooling**
   - Database connections weren't being reused (no singleton pattern)
   - `getPooledDb()` function created NEW pools without closing them (connection leak)

3. **Aggressive Auto-Save**
   - Every action triggered a save to database
   - Even with 5-second debouncing, rapid changes created many pending saves

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Database Connection Singleton Pattern
**File: `/lib/db/index.ts`**
- Implemented singleton pattern for database connections
- Reuses same connection across all requests
- Added connection caching to prevent creating new connections
- Deprecated the broken `getPooledDb()` function

### 2. Loading Coordinator Service  
**File: `/lib/loadingCoordinator.ts`**
- Prevents multiple simultaneous API calls for same data
- Shares responses between components requesting same endpoint
- Implements 1-second cache to prevent rapid reloads
- Ensures only ONE request is made even if multiple components load

### 3. Unified Dashboard API
**File: `/app/api/dashboard/route.ts`**
- Single API endpoint that fetches ALL dashboard data
- Reduces API calls from 4 separate requests to just 1
- Uses parallel queries but within single database round trip
- Dramatically reduces connection overhead

### 4. Dashboard Store Coordination
**File: `/lib/dashboardStore.ts`**
- Manages loading all dashboard data through unified API
- Updates all individual stores (Todo, Sales, Calendar, QuickLinks) at once
- Prevents individual widget loads

### 5. Updated Store Loading
**Files: `/lib/store.ts`, `/lib/salesStore.ts`, `/lib/calendarStore.ts`, `/lib/quickLinksStore.ts`**
- All stores now use LoadingCoordinator
- Prevents concurrent loads of same data
- Shares cached responses between components

### 6. Widget Component Updates
- TodoListGrid, SalesListGrid, CalendarWidget, QuickLinksGridReadOnly
- All widgets now use `useDashboardData()` hook
- Prevents individual `loadFromServer()` calls
- Coordinates loading through dashboard store

## Results

### Before Fix:
- 4 widgets × 5+ queries each = 20+ connections per user
- Multiple users = rapid connection exhaustion
- Hit 905 connection limit

### After Fix:
- 1 unified API call per dashboard load
- Singleton connection pattern
- Shared responses between components
- Connection usage reduced by ~95%

## Deployment Instructions

1. Deploy these changes to production immediately
2. Monitor Neon dashboard for connection usage
3. Connection count should stay well below limits
4. No additional configuration needed - changes are automatic

## Future Recommendations

1. **Consider implementing true connection pooling** with PgBouncer if issues persist
2. **Add monitoring alerts** for connection count thresholds
3. **Implement request batching** for further optimization
4. **Consider caching frequently accessed data** in Redis/Vercel KV
